<p>Many <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness">combinatorially difficult</a>  optimization problems can, despite their proven theoretical hardness, be solved reasonably well in practice.
The most successful approach is to use <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming">Mixed Integer Linear Programming</a> (MIP) to model the problem and then use a solver to find a solution.
The most successful solvers for MIPs are <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gurobi.com/">Gurobi</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer">CPLEX</a>, which are both commercial and expensive (though, free for academics).
There are also some open source solvers, but they are often not as powerful as the commercial ones.
However, even when investing in such a solver, the underlying techniques (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound">Branch and Bound</a>
&amp; <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_cut">Cut</a> on <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming_relaxation">Linear Relaxations</a>) struggle with some optimization problems, especially if the problem contains a lot of logical constraints that a solution has to satisfy.
In this case, the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming">Constraint Programming</a> (CP) approach may be more successful.
For Constraint Programming, there are many open source solvers, but they are often not as powerful as the commercial MIP-solvers.
While MIP-solvers are frequently able to solve problems with hundreds of thousands of variables and constraints, the classical CP-solvers often struggle with problems with more than a few thousand variables and constraints.
However, the relatively new <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver">CP-SAT</a> of Google's <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/google/or-tools/">ortools</a>
suite shows to overcome many of the weaknesses and provides a viable alternative to MIP-solvers, being competitive for many problems and sometimes even superior.</p>
<p>This unofficial primer shall help you use and understand this powerful tool, especially if you are coming from
the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming">Mixed Integer Linear Programming</a> -community, as
it may prove useful in cases where Branch and Bound performs poorly.</p>
<p>If you are relatively new to combinatorial optimization, I suggest you to read the relatively short book <a class="reference external" href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691163529/in-pursuit-of-the-traveling-salesman">In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman by Bill Cook</a> first.
It tells you a lot about the history and techniques to deal with combinatorial optimization problems, on the example of the famous <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">Traveling Salesman Problem</a>.
The Traveling Salesman Problem seems to be intractable already for small instances, but it is actually possible to solve instances with thousands of cities in practice.
It is a very light read and you can skip the more technical parts if you want to.
As an alternative, you can also read this <a class="reference external" href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~bico/papers/comp_chapter1.pdf">free chapter, coauthored by the same author</a> and
watch this very amusing <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VjphFYQKj8">YouTube Video (1hour)</a>.
If you are short on time, at least watch the video, it is really worth it.
While CP-SAT follows a slightly different approach than the one described in the book/chapter/video, it is still important to see why it is possible to do the seemingly impossible and solve such problems in practice, despite their theoretical hardness.
Additionally, you will have learned the concept of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gurobi.com/resources/math-programming-modeling-basics/">Mathematical Programming</a>, and know that the term &quot;Programming&quot; has nothing to do with programming in the sense of writing code (otherwise, additionally read the just given reference).</p>
<p>After that (or if you are already familiar with combinatorial optimization), the following content awaits you in this primer:</p>

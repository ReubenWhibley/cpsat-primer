<h1>How does it work?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-it-work" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h1>
<p>CP-SAT is a versatile <em>portfolio</em> solver, centered around a <em>Lazy Clause
Generation (LCG)</em> based Constraint Programming Solver, although it encompasses a
broader spectrum of technologies.</p>
<p>In its role as a portfolio solver, CP-SAT concurrently executes a multitude of
diverse algorithms and strategies, each possessing unique strengths and
weaknesses. These elements operate largely independently but engage in
information exchange, sharing progress when better solutions emerge or tighter
bounds become available.</p>
<p>While this may initially appear as an inefficient approach due to potential
redundancy, it proves highly effective in practice. The rationale behind this
lies in the inherent challenge of predicting which algorithm is best suited to
solve a given problem (No Free Lunch Theorem). Thus, the pragmatic strategy
involves running various approaches in parallel, with the hope that one will
effectively address the problem at hand. Note that you can also specify which
algorithms should be used if you already know which strategies are promising or
futile.</p>
<p>In contrast, Branch and Cut-based Mixed Integer Programming solvers like Gurobi
implement a more efficient partitioning of the search space to reduce
redundancy. However, they specialize in a particular strategy, which may not
always be the optimal choice, although it frequently proves to be so.</p>
<p>CP-SAT employs Branch and Cut techniques, including linear relaxations and
cutting planes, as part of its toolkit. Models that can be efficiently addressed
by a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solver are typically a good match for
CP-SAT as well. Nevertheless, CP-SAT's central focus is the implementation of
Lazy Clause Generation, harnessing SAT-solvers rather than relying primarily on
linear relaxations. As a result, CP-SAT may exhibit somewhat reduced performance
when confronted with MIP problems compared to dedicated MIP solvers. However, it
gains a distinct advantage when dealing with problems laden with intricate
logical constraints.</p>
<p>The concept behind Lazy Clause Generation involves the (incremental)
transformation of the problem into a SAT-formula, subsequently employing a
SAT-solver to seek a solution (or prove bounds by infeasibility). To mitigate
the impracticality of a straightforward conversion, Lazy Clause Generation
leverages an abundance of lazy variables and clauses.</p>
<p>Notably, the
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook%E2%80%93Levin_theorem">Cook-Levin Theorem</a>
attests that any problem within the realm of NP can be translated into a
SAT-formula. Optimization, in theory, could be achieved through a simple binary
search. However, this approach, while theoretically sound, lacks efficiency.
CP-SAT employs a more refined encoding scheme to tackle optimization problems
more effectively.</p>

<section id="the-use-of-linear-programming-techniques">
<h2>The use of linear programming techniques<a class="headerlink" href="#the-use-of-linear-programming-techniques" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>As already mentioned before, CP-SAT also utilizes the (dual) simplex algorithm
and linear relaxations. The linear relaxation is implemented as a propagator and
potentially executed at every node in the search tree but only at lowest
priority. A significant difference to the application of linear relaxations in
branch and bound algorithms is that only some pivot iterations are performed (to
make it faster). However, as there are likely much deeper search trees and the
warm-starts are utilized, the optimal linear relaxation may still be computed,
just deeper down the tree (note that for SAT-solving, the search tree is usually
traversed DFS). At root level, even cutting planes such as Gomory-Cuts are
applied to improve the linear relaxation.</p>
<p>The linear relaxation is used for detecting infeasibility (IPs can actually be
more powerful than simple SAT, at least in theory), finding better bounds for
the objective and variables, and also for making branching decisions (using the
linear relaxation's objective and the reduced costs).</p>
<p>The used Relaxation Induced Neighborhood Search RINS (LNS worker), a very
successful heuristic, of course also uses linear programming.</p>

<section id="limitations-of-cp-sat">
<h2>Limitations of CP-SAT<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations-of-cp-sat" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>While CP-SAT is undeniably a potent solver, it does possess certain limitations
when juxtaposed with alternative techniques:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>While proficient, it may not match the speed of a dedicated SAT-solver when
tasked with solving SAT-formulas, although its performance remains quite
commendable.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, for classical MIP-problems, CP-SAT may not outpace dedicated
MIP-solvers in terms of speed, although it still delivers respectable
performance.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike MIP/LP-solvers, CP-SAT lacks support for continuous variables, and the
workarounds to incorporate them may not always be highly efficient. In cases
where your problem predominantly features continuous variables and linear
constraints, opting for an LP-solver is likely to yield significantly
improved performance.</p></li>
<li><p>CP-SAT does not offer support for lazy constraints or iterative model
building, a feature available in MIP/LP-solvers and select SAT-solvers.
Consequently, the application of exponential-sized models, which are common
and pivotal in Mixed Integer Programming, may be restricted.</p></li>
<li><p>CP-SAT is limited to the Simplex algorithm and does not feature interior
point methods. This limitation prevents it from employing polynomial time
algorithms for certain classes of quadratic constraints, such as Second Order
Cone constraints. In contrast, solvers like Gurobi utilize the Barrier
algorithm to efficiently tackle these constraints in polynomial time.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>CP-SAT might also exhibit inefficiency when confronted with certain constraints,
such as modulo constraints. However, it's noteworthy that I am not aware of any
alternative solver capable of efficiently addressing these specific constraints.
At times, NP-hard problems inherently pose formidable challenges, leaving us
with no alternative but to seek more manageable modeling approaches instead of
looking for better solvers.</p>

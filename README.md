Many [combinatorially difficult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness)
optimization problems can, despite their proven theoretical hardness, be solved
reasonably well in practice. The most successful approach is to use
[Mixed Integer Linear Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming)
(MIP) to model the problem and then use a solver to find a solution. The most
successful solvers for MIPs are [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) and
[CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer), which are both
commercial and expensive (though, free for academics). There are also some open
source solvers, but they are often not as powerful as the commercial ones.
However, even when investing in such a solver, the underlying techniques
([Branch and Bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound) &
[Cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_cut) on
[Linear Relaxations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming_relaxation))
struggle with some optimization problems, especially if the problem contains a
lot of logical constraints that a solution has to satisfy. In this case, the
[Constraint Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming)
(CP) approach may be more successful. For Constraint Programming, there are many
open source solvers, but they are often not as powerful as the commercial
MIP-solvers. While MIP-solvers are frequently able to solve problems with
hundreds of thousands of variables and constraints, the classical CP-solvers
often struggle with problems with more than a few thousand variables and
constraints. However, the relatively new
[CP-SAT](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver) of Google's
[ortools](https://github.com/google/or-tools/) suite shows to overcome many of
the weaknesses and provides a viable alternative to MIP-solvers, being
competitive for many problems and sometimes even superior.

This unofficial primer shall help you use and understand this powerful tool,
especially if you are coming from the
[Mixed Integer Linear Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming)
-community, as it may prove useful in cases where Branch and Bound performs
poorly.

If you are relatively new to combinatorial optimization, I suggest you to read
the relatively short book
[In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman by Bill Cook](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691163529/in-pursuit-of-the-traveling-salesman)
first. It tells you a lot about the history and techniques to deal with
combinatorial optimization problems, on the example of the famous
[Traveling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).
The Traveling Salesman Problem seems to be intractable already for small
instances, but it is actually possible to solve instances with thousands of
cities in practice. It is a very light read and you can skip the more technical
parts if you want to. As an alternative, you can also read this
[free chapter, coauthored by the same author](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~bico/papers/comp_chapter1.pdf)
and watch this very amusing
[YouTube Video (1hour)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VjphFYQKj8). If you are
short on time, at least watch the video, it is really worth it. While CP-SAT
follows a slightly different approach than the one described in the
book/chapter/video, it is still important to see why it is possible to do the
seemingly impossible and solve such problems in practice, despite their
theoretical hardness. Additionally, you will have learned the concept of
[Mathematical Programming](https://www.gurobi.com/resources/math-programming-modeling-basics/),
and know that the term "Programming" has nothing to do with programming in the
sense of writing code (otherwise, additionally read the just given reference).

## Installation

We are using Python 3 in this primer and assume that you have a working Python 3
installation as well as the basic knowledge to use it. There are also interfaces
for other languages, but Python 3 is, in my opinion, the most convenient one, as
the mathematical expressions in Python are very close to the mathematical
notation (allowing you to spot mathematical errors much faster). Only for huge
models, you may need to use a compiled language such as C++ due to performance
issues. For smaller models, you will not notice any performance difference.

The installation of CP-SAT, which is part of the ortools package, is very easy
and can be done via Python's package manager
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```shell
pip3 install -U ortools
```

This command will also update an existing installation of ortools. As this tool
is in active development, it is recommended to update it frequently. We actually
encountered wrong behavior, i.e., bugs, in earlier versions that then have been
fixed by updates (this was on some more advanced features, don't worry about
correctness with basic usage).

I personally like to use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for
experimenting with CP-SAT.

### What hardware do I need?

It's important to note that for CP-SAT usage, you don't need the capabilities of
a supercomputer. A standard laptop is often sufficient for solving many
problems. The primary requirements are CPU power and memory bandwidth, with a
GPU being unnecessary.

In terms of CPU power, the key is balancing the number of cores with the
performance of each individual core. CP-SAT leverages all available cores,
implementing different strategies on each.
[Depending on the number of cores, CP-SAT will behave differently](https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/main/ortools/sat/docs/troubleshooting.md#improving-performance-with-multiple-workers).
However, the effectiveness of these strategies can vary, and it's usually not
apparent which one will be most effective. A higher single-core performance
means that your primary strategy will operate more swiftly. I recommend a
minimum of 4 cores and 16GB of RAM.

While CP-SAT is quite efficient in terms of memory usage, the amount of
available memory can still be a limiting factor in the size of problems you can
tackle. When it came to setting up our lab for extensive benchmarking at TU
Braunschweig, we faced a choice between desktop machines and more expensive
workstations or servers. We chose desktop machines equipped with AMD Ryzen 9
7900 CPUs (Intel would be equally suitable) and 96GB of DDR5 RAM, managed using
Slurm. This decision was driven by the fact that the performance gains from
higher-priced workstations or servers were relatively marginal compared to their
significantly higher costs. When on the road, I am often still able to do stuff
with my old Intel Macbook Pro from 2018 with an i7 and only 16GB of RAM, but
large models will overwhelm it. My workstation at home with AMD Ryzen 7 5700X
and 32GB of RAM on the other hand rarely has any problems with the models I am
working on.

For further guidance, consider the
[hardware recommendations for the Gurobi solver](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/8172407217041-What-hardware-should-I-select-when-running-Gurobi-),
which are likely to be similar. Since we frequently use Gurobi in addition to
CP-SAT, our hardware choices were also influenced by their recommendations.

## Example

Before we dive into any internals, let us take a quick look at a simple
application of CP-SAT. This example is so simple that you could solve it by
hand, but know that CP-SAT would (probably) be fine with you adding a thousand
(maybe even ten- or hundred-thousand) variables and constraints more. The basic
idea of using CP-SAT is, analogous to MIPs, to define an optimization problem in
terms of variables, constraints, and objective function, and then let the solver
find a solution for it. We call such a formulation that can be understood by the
corresponding solver a _model_ for the problem. For people not familiar with
this
[declarative approach](https://programiz.pro/resources/imperative-vs-declarative-programming/),
you can compare it to SQL, where you also just state what data you want, not how
to get it. However, it is not purely declarative, because it can still make a
huge(!) difference how you model the problem and getting that right takes some
experience and understanding of the internals. You can still get lucky for
smaller problems (let us say a few hundred to thousands of variables) and obtain
optimal solutions without having an idea of what is going on. The solvers can
handle more and more 'bad' problem models effectively with every year.

Our first problem has no deeper meaning, except of showing the basic workflow of
creating the variables (x and y), adding the constraint x+y<=30 on them, setting
the objective function (maximize 30*x + 50*y), and obtaining a solution:

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

model = cp_model.CpModel()

# Variables
x = model.NewIntVar(0, 100, "x")  # you always need to specify an upper bound.
y = model.NewIntVar(0, 100, "y")
# there are also no continuous variables: You have to decide for a resolution and then work on integers.

# Constraints
model.Add(x + y <= 30)

# Objective
model.Maximize(30 * x + 50 * y)

# Solve
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()  # Contrary to Gurobi, model and solver are separated.
status = solver.Solve(model)
assert (
    status == cp_model.OPTIMAL
)  # The status tells us if we were able to compute a solution.
print(f"x={solver.Value(x)},  y={solver.Value(y)}")
print("=====Stats:======")
print(solver.SolutionInfo())
print(solver.ResponseStats())
```

    x=0,  y=30
    =====Stats:======
    default_lp
    CpSolverResponse summary:
    status: OPTIMAL
    objective: 1500
    best_bound: 1500
    booleans: 1
    conflicts: 0
    branches: 1
    propagations: 0
    integer_propagations: 2
    restarts: 1
    lp_iterations: 0
    walltime: 0.00289923
    usertime: 0.00289951
    deterministic_time: 8e-08
    gap_integral: 5.11888e-07

Pretty easy, right? For solving a generic problem, not just one specific
instance, you would of course create a dictionary or list of variables and use
something like `model.Add(sum(vars)<=n)`, because you don't want to create the
model by hand for larger instances.

The output you get may differ from the one above, because CP-SAT actually uses a
set of different strategies in parallel, and just returns the best one (which
can differ slightly between multiple runs due to additional randomness). This is
called a portfolio strategy and is a common technique in combinatorial
optimization, if you cannot predict which strategy will perform best.

The mathematical model of the code above would usually be written by experts
something like this:

```math
\max 30x + 50y
```

```math
\text{s.t. } x+y \leq 30
```

```math
\quad 0\leq x \leq 100
```

```math
\quad 0\leq y \leq 100
```

```math
x,y \in \mathbb{Z}
```

The `s.t.` stands for `subject to`, sometimes also read as `such that`.

Here are some further examples, if you are not yet satisfied:

- [N-queens](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/queens) (this one
  also gives you a quick introduction to constraint programming, but it may be
  misleading because CP-SAT is no classical
  [FD(Finite Domain)-solver](http://www.gameaipro.com/GameAIPro2/GameAIPro2_Chapter26_Rolling_Your_Own_Finite-Domain_Constraint_Solver.pdf).
  This example probably has been modified from the previous generation, which is
  also explained at the end.)
- [Employee Scheduling](https://developers.google.com/optimization/scheduling/employee_scheduling)
- [Job Shop Problem](https://developers.google.com/optimization/scheduling/job_shop)
- More examples can be found in
  [the official repository](https://github.com/google/or-tools/tree/stable/ortools/sat/samples)
  for multiple languages (yes, CP-SAT does support more than just Python). As
  the Python-examples are named in
  [snake-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case), they are at the end of
  the list.

Ok. Now that you have seen a minimal model, let us look on what options we have
to model a problem. Note that an experienced optimizer may be able to model most
problems with just the elements shown above, but showing your intentions may
help CP-SAT optimize your problem better. Contrary to Mixed Integer Programming,
you also do not need to fine-tune any
[Big-Ms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_M_method) (a reason to model
higher-level constraints, such as conditional constraints that are only enforced
if some variable is set to true, in MIPs yourself, because the computer is not
very good at that).

---

## Modelling

CP-SAT provides us with much more modelling options than the classical
MIP-solver. Instead of just the classical linear constraints (<=, ==, >=), we
have various advanced constraints such as `AllDifferent` or
`AddMultiplicationEquality`. This spares you the burden of modelling the logic
only with linear constraints, but also makes the interface more extensive.
Additionally, you have to be aware that not all constraints are equally
efficient. The most efficient constraints are linear or boolean constraints.
Constraints such as `AddMultiplicationEquality` can be significantly(!!!) more
expensive.

This primer does not have the space to teach about building good models. In the
following, we will primarily look onto a selection of useful constraints. If you
want to learn how to build models, you could take a look into the book
[Model Building in Mathematical Programming by H. Paul Williams](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Model+Building+in+Mathematical+Programming%2C+5th+Edition-p-9781118443330)
which covers much more than you probably need, including some actual
applications. This book is of course not for CP-SAT, but the general techniques
and ideas carry over. However, it can also suffice to simply look on some other
models and try some things out. If you are completely new to this area, you may
want to check out modelling for the MIP-solver Gurobi in this
[video course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHiHZENG6W8CezJLx_cw9mNqpmviq3lO9).
Remember that many things are similar to CP-SAT, but not everything (as already
mentioned, CP-SAT is especially interesting for the cases where a MIP-solver
fails).

The following part does not cover all constraints. You can get a complete
overview by looking into the
[official documentation](https://developers.google.com/optimization/reference/python/sat/python/cp_model#cp_model.CpModel).
Simply go to `CpModel` and check out the `AddXXX` and `NewXXX` methods.

### Variables

There are two important types of variables in CP-SAT: Booleans and Integers
(which are actually converted to Booleans, but more on this later). There are
also, e.g.,
[interval variables](https://developers.google.com/optimization/reference/python/sat/python/cp_model#intervalvar),
but they are not as important and can be modelled easily with integer variables.
For the integer variables, you have to specify a lower and an upper bound.

```python
# integer variable z with bounds -100 <= z <= 100
z = model.NewIntVar(-100, 100, "z")
# boolean variable b
b = model.NewBoolVar("b")
# implicitly available negation of b:
not_b = b.Not()  # will be 1 if b is 0 and 0 if b is 1
```

> Having tight bounds on the integer variables can make a huge impact on the
> performance. It may be useful to run some optimization heuristics beforehand
> to get some bounds. Reducing it by a few percent can already pay off for some
> problems.

There are no continuous/floating point variables (or even constants) in CP-SAT:
If you need floating point numbers, you have to approximate them with integers
by some resolution. For example, you could simply multiply all values by 100 for
a step size of 0.01. A value of 2.35 would then be represented by 235. This
_could_ probably be implemented in CP-SAT directly, but doing it explicitly is
not difficult, and it has numerical implications that you should be aware of.

The lack of continuous variables may sound like a serious limitation, especially
if you have a background in linear optimization (where continuous variables are
the "easy part"), but as long as they are not a huge part of your problem, you
can often work around it. I had problems with many continuous variables on which
I had to apply absolute values and conditional linear constraints, and CP-SAT
performed much better than Gurobi, which is known to be very good at continuous
variables. In this case, CP-SAT struggled less with the continuous variables
(Gurobi's strength), than Gurobi with the logical constraints (CP-SAT's
strength). In a further analysis, I noted an only logarithmic increase of the
runtime with the resolution. However, there are also problems for which a higher
resolution can drastically increase the runtime. The packing problem, which is
discussed further below, has the following runtime for different resolutions:
1x: 0.02s, 10x: 0.7s, 100x: 7.6s, 1000x: 75s, 10_000x: >15min. The solution was
always the same, just scaled, and there was no objective, i.e., only a feasible
solution had to be found. Note that this is just an example, not a
representative benchmark. See
[./examples/add_no_overlap_2d_scaling.ipynb](./examples/add_no_overlap_2d_scaling.ipynb)
for the code. If you have a problem with a lot of continuous variables, such as
[network flow problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_flow_problem), you
are probably better served with a MIP-solver.

In my experience, boolean variables are by far the most important variables in
many combinatorial optimization problems. Many problems, such as the famous
Traveling Salesman Problem, only consist of boolean variables. Implementing a
solver specialized on boolean variables by using a SAT-solver as a base, such as
CP-SAT, thus, is quite sensible. The resolution of coefficients (in combination
with boolean variables) is less critical than for variables.

You might question the need for naming variables in your model. While it's true
that CP-SAT wouldn't need named variables to work (as it could just give them
automatically generated names), assigning names is incredibly useful for
debugging purposes. Solver APIs often create an internal representation of your
model, which is subsequently used by the solver. There are instances where you
might need to examine this internal model, such as when debugging issues like
infeasibility. In such scenarios, having named variables can significantly
enhance the clarity of the internal representation, making your debugging
process much more manageable.

#### Domain Variables

_This section is especially for those with a constraint programming background,
who may be tempted to use domain variables instead of sticking to boolean and
integer variables. Everyone else can probably skip this section._

When dealing with integer variables that you know will only need to take certain
values, or when you wish to limit their possible values, domain variables can
become interesting. Unlike regular integer variables, domain variables are
tailored to represent a specific set of values. This approach can enhance
efficiency when the domain - the range of sensible values - is small. However,
it may not be the best choice for larger domains.

CP-SAT works by converting all integer variables into boolean variables
(warning: simplification). For each potential value, it creates two boolean
variables: one indicating whether the integer variable is equal to this value,
and another indicating whether it is less than or equal to it. This is called an
_order encoding_. At first glance, this might suggest that using domain
variables is always preferable, as it appears to reduce the number of boolean
variables needed.

However, CP-SAT employs a lazy creation strategy for these boolean variables.
This means it only generates them as needed, based on the solver's
decision-making process. Therefore, an integer variable with a wide range - say,
from 0 to 100 - won't immediately result in 200 boolean variables. It might lead
to the creation of only a few, depending on the solver's requirements.

Limiting the domain of a variable can have drawbacks. Firstly, defining a domain
explicitly can be computationally costly and increase the model size drastically
as it now need to contain not just a lower and upper bound for a variable but an
explicit list of numbers (model size is often a limiting factor). Secondly, by
narrowing down the solution space, you might inadvertently make it more
challenging for the solver to find a viable solution. First, try to let CP-SAT
handle the domain of your variables itself and only intervene if you have a good
reason to do so.

If you choose to utilize domain variables for their benefits in specific
scenarios, here is how to define them:

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

# Define a domain with selected values
domain = cp_model.Domain.FromValues([2, 5, 8, 10, 20, 50, 90])

# Create a domain variable within this defined domain
x = model.NewIntVarFromDomain(domain, "x")
```

This example illustrates the process of creating a domain variable `x` that can
only take on the values specified in `domain`. This method is particularly
useful when you are working with variables that only have a meaningful range of
possible values within your problem's context.

### Objectives

Not every problem actually has an objective, sometimes you only need to find a
feasible solution. CP-SAT is pretty good at doing that (MIP-solvers are often
not). However, CP-SAT can also optimize pretty well (older constraint
programming solver cannot, at least in my experience). You can minimize or
maximize a linear expression (use auxiliary variables and constraints to model
more complicated expressions).

You can specify the objective function by calling `model.Minimize` or
`model.Maximize` with a linear expression.

```python
model.Maximize(30 * x + 50 * y)
```

Let us look on how to model more complicated expressions, using boolean
variables and generators.

```python
x_vars = [model.NewBoolVar(f"x{i}") for i in range(10)]
model.Minimize(
    sum(i * x_vars[i] if i % 2 == 0 else i * x_vars[i].Not() for i in range(10))
)
```

This objective evaluates to

```math
\min \sum_{i=0}^{9} i\cdot x_i \text{ if } i \text{ is even else } i\cdot \neg x_i
```

To implement a
[lexicographic optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_optimization),
you can do multiple rounds and always fix the previous objective as constraint.

```python
model.Maximize(30 * x + 50 * y)

# Lexicographic
solver.Solve(model)
model.Add(30 * x + 50 * y == int(solver.ObjectiveValue()))  # fix previous objective
model.Minimize(z)  # optimize for second objective
solver.Solve(model)
```

To implement non-linear objectives, you can use auxiliary variables and
constraints. For example, you can create a variable that is the absolute value
of another variable and then use this variable in the objective.

```python
abs_x = model.NewIntVar(0, 100, "|x|")
model.AddAbsEquality(target=abs_x, expr=x)
model.Minimize(abs_x)
```

The available constraints are discussed next.

### Linear Constraints

These are the classical constraints also used in linear optimization. Remember
that you are still not allowed to use floating point numbers within it. Same as
for linear optimization: You are not allowed to multiply a variable with
anything else than a constant and also not to apply any further mathematical
operations.

```python
model.Add(10 * x + 15 * y <= 10)
model.Add(x + z == 2 * y)

# This one actually isn't linear but still works.
model.Add(x + y != z)

# For <, > you can simply use <= and -1 because we are working on integers.
model.Add(x <= z - 1)  # x < z
```

Note that `!=` can be expected slower than the other (`<=`, `>=`, `==`)
constraints, because it is not a linear constraint. If you have a set of
mutually `!=` variables, it is better to use `AllDifferent` (see below) than to
use the explicit `!=` constraints.

> 0.763445 == 0.763439 to still be considered equal to counter numerical issues
> of floating point arithmetic. In CP-SAT, you have to make sure that values can
> match exactly.

### Logical Constraints (Propositional Logic)

You can actually model logical constraints also as linear constraints, but it
may be advantageous to show your intent:

```python
b1 = model.NewBoolVar("b1")
b2 = model.NewBoolVar("b2")
b3 = model.NewBoolVar("b3")

model.AddBoolOr(b1, b2, b3)  # b1 or b2 or b3 (at least one)
model.AddBoolAnd(b1, b2.Not(), b3.Not())  # b1 and not b2 and not b3 (all)
model.AddBoolXOr(b1, b2, b3)  # b1 xor b2 xor b3
model.AddImplication(b1, b2)  # b1 -> b2
```

In this context you could also mention `AddAtLeastOne`, `AddAtMostOne`, and
`AddExactlyOne`, but these can also be modelled as linear constraints.

### Conditional Constraints (Channeling, Reification)

Linear constraints (Add), BoolOr, and BoolAnd support being activated by a
condition. This is not only a very helpful constraint for many applications, but
it is also a constraint that is highly inefficient to model with linear
optimization ([Big M Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_M_method)). My
current experience shows that CP-SAT can work much more efficiently with this
kind of constraint. Note that you only can use a boolean variable and not
directly add an expression, i.e., maybe you need to create an auxiliary
variable.

```python
model.Add(x + z == 2 * y).OnlyEnforceIf(b1)
model.Add(x + z == 10).OnlyEnforceIf([b2, b3.Not()])  # only enforce if b2 AND NOT b3
```

### AllDifferent

A constraint that is often seen in Constraint Programming, but I myself was
always able to deal without it. Still, you may find it important. It forces all
(integer) variables to have a different value.

`AllDifferent` is actually the only constraint that may use a domain based
propagator (if it is not a permutation)
[[source](https://youtu.be/lmy1ddn4cyw?t=624)]

```python
model.AddAllDifferent(x, y, z)

# You can also add a constant to the variables.
vars = [model.NewIntVar(0, 10) for i in range(10)]
model.AddAllDifferent(x + i for i, x in enumerate(vars))
```

The [N-queens](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/queens) example of
the official tutorial makes use of this constraint.

There is a big caveat with this constraint: CP-SAT now has a preprocessing step
that automatically tries to infer large `AllDifferent` constraints from sets of
mutual `!=` constraints. This inference equals the NP-hard Edge Clique Cover
problem, thus, is not a trivial task. If you add an `AllDifferent` constraint
yourself, CP-SAT will assume that you already took care of this inference and
will skip this step. Thus, adding a single `AllDifferent` constraint can make
your model significantly slower, if you also use `!=` constraints. If you do not
use `!=` constraints, you can safely use `AllDifferent` without any performance
penalty. You may also want to use `!=` instead of `AllDifferent` if you apply it
to overlapping sets of variables without proper optimization, because then
CP-SAT will do the inference for you.

In [./examples/add_all_different.ipynb](./examples/add_all_different.ipynb) you
can find a quick experiment based on the graph coloring problem. In the graph
coloring problem, the colors of two adjacent vertices have to be different. This
can be easily modelled by `!=` or `AllDifferent` constraints on every edge.
Using `!=`, we can solve the example graph in around 5 seconds. If we use
`AllDifferent`, it takes more than 5 minutes. If we manually disable the
`AllDifferent` inference, it also takes more than 5 minutes. Same if we add just
a single `AllDifferent` constraint. Thus, if you use `AllDifferent` do it
properly on large sets, or use `!=` constraints and let CP-SAT infer the
`AllDifferent` constraints for you.

Maybe CP-SAT will allow you to use `AllDifferent` without any performance
penalty in the future, but for now, you have to be aware of this. See also
[the optimization parameter documentation](https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/1d696f9108a0ebfd99feb73b9211e2f5a6b0812b/ortools/sat/sat_parameters.proto#L542).

### Absolute Values and Max/Min

Two often occurring and important operators are absolute values as well as
minimum and maximum values. You cannot use operators directly in the
constraints, but you can use them via an auxiliary variable and a dedicated
constraint. These constraints are reasonably efficient in my experience.

```python
# abs_xz == |x+z|
abs_xz = model.NewIntVar(0, 200, "|x+z|")  # ub = ub(x)+ub(z)
model.AddAbsEquality(target=abs_xz, expr=x + z)
# max_xyz = max(x,y,z)
max_xyz = model.NewIntVar(0, 100, "max(x,y, z)")
model.AddMaxEquality(max_xyz, [x, y, z])
# min_xyz = min(x,y,z)
min_xyz = model.NewIntVar(-100, 100, " min(x,y, z)")
model.AddMinEquality(min_xyz, [x, y, z])
```

### Multiplication and Modulo

A big nono in linear optimization (the most successful optimization area) are
multiplication of variables (because this would no longer be linear, right...).
Often we can linearize the model by some tricks and tools like Gurobi are also
able to do some non-linear optimization ( in the end, it is most often
translated to a less efficient linear model again). CP-SAT can also work with
multiplication and modulo of variables, again as constraint not as operation. So
far, I have not made good experience with these constraints, i.e., the models
end up being slow to solve, and would recommend to only use them if you really
need them and cannot find a way around them.

```python
xyz = model.NewIntVar(-100 * 100 * 100, 100**3, "x*y*z")
model.AddMultiplicationEquality(xyz, [x, y, z])  # xyz = x*y*z
model.AddModuloEquality(x, y, 3)  # x = y % 3
```

> variables is supported, but I got an error when trying it out. I have not

### Circuit/Tour-Constraints

The
[Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)
or Hamiltonicity Problem are important and difficult problems that occur as
subproblem in many contexts. For solving the classical TSP, you should use the
extremely powerful solver
[Concorde](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde.html). There is also a
separate [part in ortools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing)
dedicated to routing. If it is just a subproblem, you can add a simple
constraint by encoding the allowed edges as triples of start vertex index,
target vertex index, and literal/variable. Note that this is using directed
edges/arcs. By adding a triple (v,v,var), you can allow CP-SAT to skip the
vertex v.

> If the tour-problem is the fundamental part of your problem, you may be better
> served with using a Mixed Integer Programming solver. Don't expect to solve
> tours much larger than 250 vertices with CP-SAT.

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

# Weighted, directed graph as instance
# (source, destination) -> cost
dgraph = {
    (0, 1): 13,
    (1, 0): 17,
    (1, 2): 16,
    (2, 1): 19,
    (0, 2): 22,
    (2, 0): 14,
    (3, 0): 15,
    (3, 1): 28,
    (3, 2): 25,
    (0, 3): 24,
    (1, 3): 11,
    (2, 3): 27,
}
model = cp_model.CpModel()
# Variables: Binary decision variables for the edges
edge_vars = {(u, v): model.NewBoolVar(f"e_{u}_{v}") for (u, v) in dgraph.keys()}
# Constraints: Add Circuit constraint
# We need to tell CP-SAT which variable corresponds to which edge.
# This is done by passing a list of tuples (u,v,var) to AddCircuit.
circuit = [
    (u, v, var) for (u, v), var in edge_vars.items()  # (source, destination, variable)
]
model.AddCircuit(circuit)

# Objective: minimize the total cost of edges
obj = sum(dgraph[(u, v)] * x for (u, v), x in edge_vars.items())
model.Minimize(obj)

# Solve
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
status = solver.Solve(model)
assert status in (cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE)
tour = [(u, v) for (u, v), x in edge_vars.items() if solver.Value(x)]
print("Tour:", tour)
```

    Tour: [(0, 1), (2, 0), (3, 2), (1, 3)]

You can use this constraint very flexibly for many tour problems. We added three
examples:

- [./examples/add_circuit.py](./examples/add_circuit.py): The example above,
  slightly extended. Find out how large you can make the graph.
- [./examples/add_circuit_budget.py](./examples/add_circuit_budget.py): Find the
  largest tour with a given budget. This will be a bit more difficult to solve.
- [./examples/add_circuit_multi_tour.py](./examples/add_circuit_multi_tour.py):
  Allow $k$ tours, which in sum need to be minimal and cover all vertices.

The most powerful TSP-solver _concorde_ uses a linear programming based
approach, but with a lot of additional techniques to improve the performance.
The book _In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman_ by William Cook may have already
given you some insights. For more details, you can also read the more advanced
book _The Traveling Salesman Problem: A Computational Study_ by Applegate,
Bixby, Chvatál, and Cook. If you need to solve some variant, MIP-solvers (which
could be called a generalization of that approach) are known to perform well
using the
[Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson Formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem#Dantzig%E2%80%93Fulkerson%E2%80%93Johnson_formulation).
This model is theoretically exponential, but using lazy constraints (which are
added when needed), it can be solved efficiently in practice. The
[Miller-Tucker-Zemlin formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem#Miller%E2%80%93Tucker%E2%80%93Zemlin_formulation[21])
allows a small formulation size, but is bad in practice with MIP-solvers due to
its weak linear relaxations. Because CP-SAT does not allow lazy constraints, the
Danzig-Fulkerson-Johnson formulation would require many iterations and a lot of
wasted resources. As CP-SAT does not suffer as much from weak linear relaxations
(replacing Big-M by logic constraints, such as `OnlyEnforceIf`), the
Miller-Tucker-Zemlin formulation may be an option in some cases, though a simple
experiment (see below) shows a similar performance as the iterative approach.
When using `AddCircuit`, CP-SAT will actually use the LP-technique for the
linear relaxation (so using this constraint may really help, as otherwise CP-SAT
will not know that your manual constraints are actually a tour with a nice
linear relaxation), and probably has the lazy constraints implemented
internally. Using the `AddCircuit` constraint is thus highly recommendable for
any circle or path constraints.

In
[./examples/add_circuit_comparison.ipynb](./examples/add_circuit_comparison.ipynb),
we compare the performance of some models for the TSP, to estimate the
performance of CP-SAT for the TSP.

- **AddCircuit** can solve the Euclidean TSP up to a size of around 110 vertices
  in 10 seconds to optimality.
- **MTZ (Miller-Tucker-Zemlin)** can solve the eculidean TSP up to a size of
  around 50 vertices in 10 seconds to optimality.
- **Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson via iterative solving** can solve the eculidean
  TSP up to a size of around 50 vertices in 10 seconds to optimality.
- **Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson via lazy constraints in Gurobi** can solve the
  eculidean TSP up to a size of around 225 vertices in 10 seconds to optimality.

This tells you to use a MIP-solver for problems dominated by the tour
constraint, and if you have to use CP-SAT, you should definitely use the
`AddCircuit` constraint.

Here is the performance of `AddCircuit` for the TSP on some instances (rounded
eucl. distance) from the TSPLIB with a time limit of 90 seconds.

### Array operations

You can even go completely bonkers and work with arrays in your model. The
element at a variable index can be accessed via an `AddElement` constraint.

The second constraint is actually more of a stable matching in array form. For
two arrays of variables $v,w, |v|=|w|$, it requires
$v[i]=j \Leftrightarrow w[j]=i \quad \forall i,j \in 0,\ldots,|v|-1$. Note that
this restricts the values of the variables in the arrays to $0,\ldots, |v|-1$.

```python
# ai = [x,y,z][i]  assign ai the value of the i-th entry.
ai = model.NewIntVar(-100, 100, "a[i]")
i = model.NewIntVar(0, 2, "i")
model.AddElement(index=i, variables=[x, y, z], target=ai)

model.AddInverse([x, y, z], [z, y, x])
```

### Interval Variables and No-Overlap Constraints

A special case of variables are the interval variables, that allow to model
intervals, i.e., a span of some length with a start and an end. There are fixed
length intervals, flexible length intervals, and optional intervals to model
various use cases. These intervals become interesting in combination with the
no-overlap constraints for 1D and 2D. We can use this for geometric packing
problems, scheduling problems, and many other problems, where we have to prevent
overlaps between intervals. These variables are special because they are
actually not a variable, but a container that bounds separately defined start,
length, and end variables.

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

start_var = model.NewIntVar(0, 100, 'start')
length_var = model.NewIntVar(10, 20, 'length')
end_var = model.NewIntVar(0, 100, 'end')
is_present_var = model.NewBoolVar('is_present')

# creating an interval of fixed length
fixed_interval = model.NewFixedSizeIntervalVar(start=start_var, size=10, end=end_var, name='fixed_interval')
# creating an interval whose length can be influenced by a variable (more expensive)
flexible_interval = model.NewIntervalVar(start=start_var, size=length_var, end=end_var, name='flexible_interval')
# creating an interval that can be present or not
optional_fixed_interval = model.NewOptionalFixedSizeIntervalVar(start=start_var, size=10, end=end_var, is_present=is_present_var, name='optional_fixed_interval')
# creating an interval that can be present or not and whose length can be influenced by a variable (most expensive)
optional_interval = model.NewOptionalIntervalVar(start=start_var, size=length_var, end=end_var, is_present=is_present_var, name='optional_interval')
```

There are now the two no-overlap constraints for 1D and 2D that can be used to
prevent overlaps between intervals. The 1D no-overlap constraint is used to
prevent overlaps between intervals on a single dimension, e.g., time. The 2D
no-overlap constraint is used to prevent overlaps between intervals on two
dimensions, e.g., time and resources or for packing rectangles.

```python
# 1D no-overlap constraint
model.AddNoOverlap([... interval vars...])
# 2D no-overlap constraint. The two lists need to have the same length.
model.AddNoOverlap2D([... interval vars first dimension...], [... interval vars second dimension...])
```

Let us take a quick look on how we can use this to check if we can pack a set of
rectangles into a container without overlaps. This can be an interesting problem
in logistics, where we have to pack boxes into a container, or in cutting stock
problems, where we have to cut pieces from a larger piece of material.

```python
class RectanglePackingWithoutRotationsModel:
    def __init__(self, instance: Instance) -> None:
        self.instance = instance
        self.model = cp_model.CpModel()

        # We have to create the variable for the bottom left corner of the boxes.
        # We directly limit their range, such that the boxes are inside the container
        self.x_vars = [
            self.model.NewIntVar(
                0, instance.container.width - box.width, name=f"x1_{i}"
            )
            for i, box in enumerate(instance.rectangles)
        ]
        self.y_vars = [
            self.model.NewIntVar(
                0, instance.container.height - box.height, name=f"y1_{i}"
            )
            for i, box in enumerate(instance.rectangles)
        ]

        # Interval variables are actually more like constraint containers, that are then passed to the no overlap constraint
        # Note that we could also make size and end variables, but we don't need them here
        x_interval_vars = [
            self.model.NewFixedSizeIntervalVar(
                start=self.x_vars[i],  # the x value of the bottom left corner
                size=box.width,  # the width of the rectangle
                name=f"x_interval_{i}",
            )
            for i, box in enumerate(instance.rectangles)
        ]
        y_interval_vars = [
            self.model.NewFixedSizeIntervalVar(
                start=self.y_vars[i],  # the y value of the bottom left corner
                size=box.height,  # the height of the rectangle
                name=f"y_interval_{i}",
            )
            for i, box in enumerate(instance.rectangles)
        ]
        # Enforce that no two rectangles overlap
        self.model.AddNoOverlap2D(x_interval_vars, y_interval_vars)

    def _extract_solution(self, solver: cp_model.CpSolver) -> Optional[Solution]:
        if self.status not in (cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE):
            return None
        placements = []
        for i, box in enumerate(self.instance.rectangles):
            x = solver.Value(self.x_vars[i])
            y = solver.Value(self.y_vars[i])
            placements.append(Placement(x=x, y=y))
        return Solution(placements=placements)

    def solve(self, time_limit: float = 900.0):
        solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
        solver.parameters.log_search_progress = True
        solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = time_limit
        self.status = solver.Solve(self.model)
        self.solution = self._extract_solution(solver)
        self.upper_bound = solver.BestObjectiveBound()
        self.objective_value = solver.ObjectiveValue()
        return self.status

    def is_infeasible(self):
        return self.status == cp_model.INFEASIBLE

    def is_feasible(self):
        return self.status in (cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE)
```

The optional intervals with flexible length allow us to even model rotations and
instead of just checking if a feasible packing exists, finding the largest
possible packing. The code may look a bit more complex, but considering the
complexity of the problem, it is still quite simple.

```python
class RectangleKnapsackWithRotationsModel:
    def __init__(self, instance: Instance) -> None:
        self.instance = instance
        self.model = cp_model.CpModel()

        # Create coordinates for the placement. We need variables for the begin and end of each rectangle.
        # This will also ensure that the rectangles are placed inside the container.
        self.bottom_left_x_vars = [
            self.model.NewIntVar(0, instance.container.width, name=f"x1_{i}")
            for i, box in enumerate(instance.rectangles)
        ]
        self.bottom_left_y_vars = [
            self.model.NewIntVar(0, instance.container.height, name=f"y1_{i}")
            for i, box in enumerate(instance.rectangles)
        ]
        self.upper_right_x_vars = [
            self.model.NewIntVar(0, instance.container.width, name=f"x2_{i}")
            for i, box in enumerate(instance.rectangles)
        ]
        self.upper_right_y_vars = [
            self.model.NewIntVar(0, instance.container.height, name=f"y2_{i}")
            for i, box in enumerate(instance.rectangles)
        ]
        # These variables indicate if a rectangle is rotated or not
        self.rotated_vars = [
            self.model.NewBoolVar(f"rotated_{i}")
            for i in range(len(instance.rectangles))
        ]
        # Depending on if a rectangle is rotated or not, we have to adjust the width and height variables
        self.width_vars = [
            self.model.NewIntVar(0, max(box.width, box.height), name=f"width_{i}")
            for i, box in enumerate(instance.rectangles)
        ]
        self.height_vars = [

most of the rectangles even for the larger instances.

#### Resolution and Parameters

In earlier versions of CP-SAT, the performance of no-overlap constraints was
greatly influenced by the resolution. This impact has evolved, yet it remains
somewhat inconsistent. In a notebook example, I explored how resolution affects
the execution time of the no-overlap constraint in versions 9.3 and 9.8 of
CP-SAT. For version 9.3, there is a noticeable increase in execution time as the
resolution grows. Conversely, in version 9.8, execution time actually reduces
when the resolution is higher, a finding supported by repeated tests. This
unexpected behavior suggests that the performance of CP-SAT regarding no-overlap
constraints has not stabilized and may continue to vary in upcoming versions.

| Resolution | Runtime (CP-SAT 9.3) | Runtime (CP-SAT 9.8) |
| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1x         | 0.02s                | 0.03s                |
| 10x        | 0.7s                 | 0.02s                |
| 100x       | 7.6s                 | 1.1s                 |
| 1000x      | 75s                  | 40.3s                |
| 10_000x    | >15min               | 0.4s                 |

[This notebook](./examples/add_no_overlap_2d.ipynb) was used to create the table
above.

However, while playing around with less documented features, I noticed that the
performance for the older version can be improved drastically with the following
parameters:

```python
solver.parameters.use_energetic_reasoning_in_no_overlap_2d = True
solver.parameters.use_timetabling_in_no_overlap_2d = True
solver.parameters.use_pairwise_reasoning_in_no_overlap_2d = True
```

With the latest version of CP-SAT, I did not notice a significant difference in
performance when using these parameters.

### There is more

CP-SAT has even more constraints, but I think I covered the most important ones.
If you need more, you can check out the
[official documentation](https://developers.google.com/optimization/reference/python/sat/python/cp_model#cp_model.CpModel).

---

## Parameters

The CP-SAT solver has a lot of parameters to control its behavior. They are
implemented via
[Protocol Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) and can be
manipulated via the `parameters`-member. If you want to find out all options,
you can check the reasonably well documented `proto`-file in the
[official repository](https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/stable/ortools/sat/sat_parameters.proto).
I will give you the most important right below.

> :warning: Only a few of the parameters (e.g., timelimit) are
> beginner-friendly. Most other parameters (e.g., decision strategies) should
> not be touched as the defaults are well-chosen, and it is likely that you will
> interfere with some optimizations. If you need a better performance, try to
> improve your model of the optimization problem.

### Time limit and Status

If we have a huge model, CP-SAT may not be able to solve it to optimality (if
the constraints are not too difficult, there is a good chance we still get a
good solution). Of course, we don't want CP-SAT to run endlessly for hours
(years, decades,...) but simply abort after a fixed time and return us the best
solution so far. If you are now asking yourself why you should use a tool that
may run forever: There are simply no provably faster algorithms and considering
the combinatorial complexity, it is incredible that it works so well. Those not
familiar with the concepts of NP-hardness and combinatorial complexity, I
recommend reading the book 'In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman' by William
Cook. Actually, I recommend this book to anyone into optimization: It is a
beautiful and light weekend-read.

To set a time limit (in seconds), we can simply set the following value before
we run the solver:

```python
solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = 60  # 60s timelimit
```

We now of course have the problem, that maybe we won't have an optimal solution,
or a solution at all, we can continue on. Thus, we need to check the status of
the solver.

```python
status = solver.Solve(model)
if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL or status == cp_model.FEASIBLE:
    print("We have a solution.")
else:
    print("Help?! No solution available! :( ")
```

The following status codes are possible:

- `OPTIMAL`: Perfect, we have an optimal solution.
- `FEASIBLE`: Good, we have at least a feasible solution (we may also have a
  bound available to check the quality via `solver.BestObjectiveBound()`).
- `INFEASIBLE`: There is a proof that no solution can satisfy all our
  constraints.
- `MODEL_INVALID`: You used CP-SAT wrongly.
- `UNKNOWN`: No solution was found, but also no infeasibility proof. Thus, we
  actually know nothing. Maybe there is at least a bound available?

If you want to print the status, you can use `solver.StatusName(status)`.

We can not only limit the runtime but also tell CP-SAT, we are satisfied with a
solution within a specific, provable quality range. For this, we can set the
parameters `absolute_gap_limit` and `relative_gap_limit`. The absolute limit
tells CP-SAT to stop as soon as the solution is at most a specific value apart
to the bound, the relative limit is relative to the bound. More specifically,
CP-SAT will stop as soon as the objective value(O) is within relative ratio
$abs(O - B) / max(1, abs(O))$ of the bound (B). To stop as soon as we are within
5% of the optimum, we could state (TODO: Check)

```python
solver.parameters.relative_gap_limit = 0.05
```

Now we may want to stop after we didn't make progress for some time or whatever.
In this case, we can make use of the solution callbacks.

> For those familiar with Gurobi: Unfortunately, we can only abort the solution
> progress and not add lazy constraints or similar. For those not familiar with

For adding a solution callback, we have to inherit from a base class. The
documentation of the base class and the available operations can be found in the
[documentation](https://developers.google.com/optimization/reference/python/sat/python/cp_model#cp_model.CpSolverSolutionCallback).

```python
class MySolutionCallback(cp_model.CpSolverSolutionCallback):
    def __init__(self, stuff):
        cp_model.CpSolverSolutionCallback.__init__(self)
        self.stuff = stuff  # just to show that we can save some data in the callback.

    def on_solution_callback(self):
        obj = self.ObjectiveValue()  # best solution value
        bound = self.BestObjectiveBound()  # best bound
        print(f"The current value of x is {self.Value(x)}")
        if abs(obj - bound) < 10:
            self.StopSearch()  # abort search for better solution
        # ...


solver.Solve(model, MySolutionCallback(None))
```

You can find an
[official example of using such callbacks](https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/stable/ortools/sat/samples/stop_after_n_solutions_sample_sat.py)
.

Beside querying the objective value of the currently best solution, the solution
itself, and the best known bound, you can also find out about internals such as
`NumBooleans(self)`, `NumConflicts(self)`, `NumBranches(self)`. What those
values mean will be discussed later.

### Parallelization

CP-SAT has some basic parallelization. It can be considered a portfolio-strategy
with some minimal data exchange between the threads. The basic idea is to use
different techniques and may the best fitting one win (as an experienced
optimizer, it can actually be very enlightening to see which technique
contributed how much at which phase as visible in the logs).

1. The first thread performs the default search: The optimization problem is
   converted into a Boolean satisfiability problem and solved with a Variable
   State Independent Decaying Sum (VSIDS) algorithm. A search heuristic
   introduces additional literals for branching when needed, by selecting an
   integer variable, a value and a branching direction. The model also gets
   linearized to some degree, and the corresponding LP gets (partially) solved
   with the (dual) Simplex-algorithm to support the satisfiability model.
2. The second thread uses a fixed search if a decision strategy has been
   specified. Otherwise, it tries to follow the LP-branching on the linearized
   model.
3. The third thread uses Pseudo-Cost branching. This is a technique from mixed
   integer programming, where we branch on the variable that had the highest
   influence on the objective in prior branches. Of course, this only provides
   useful values after we have already performed some branches on the variable.
4. The fourth thread is like the first thread but without linear relaxation.
5. The fifth thread does the opposite and uses the default search but with
   maximal linear relaxation, i.e., also constraints that are more expensive to
   linearize are linearized. This can be computationally expensive but provides
   good lower bounds for some models.
6. The sixth thread performs a core based search from the SAT- community. This
   approach extracts unsatisfiable cores of the formula and is good for finding
   lower bounds.
7. All further threads perform a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) for obtaining
   good solutions.

Note that this information may no longer be completely accurate (if it ever
was). To set the number of used cores/workers, simply do:

```python
solver.parameters.num_search_workers = 8  # use 8 cores
```

If you want to use more LNS-worker, you can specify
`solver.parameters.min_num_lns_workers` (default 2). You can also specify how
the different cores should be used by configuring/reordering.

```
# make sure list is empty
while solver.paramters.subsolvers:
   solver.parameters.subsolvers.pop()
# set new list
solver.parameters.subsolvers.extend(["default_lp", "fixed", "less_encoding", "no_lp", "max_lp", "pseudo_costs", "reduced_costs", "quick_restart", "quick_restart_no_lp", "lb_tree_search", "probing"])
```

This can be interesting, e.g., if you are using CP-SAT especially because the
linear relaxation is not useful (and the BnB-algorithm performing badly). There
are even more options, but for these you can simply look into the
[documentation](https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/49b6301e1e1e231d654d79b6032e79809868a70e/ortools/sat/sat_parameters.proto#L513).
Be aware that fine-tuning such a solver is not a simple task, and often you do
more harm than good by tinkering around. However, I noticed that decreasing the
number of search workers can actually improve the runtime for some problems.
This indicates that at least selecting the right subsolvers that are best fitted
for your problem can be worth a shot. For example `max_lp` is probably a waste
of resources if you know that your model has a terrible linear relaxation. In
this context I want to recommend having a look on some relaxed solutions when
dealing with difficult problems to get a better understanding of which parts a
solver may struggle with (use a linear programming solver, like Gurobi, for
this).

[CP-SAT also has different parallelization tiers based on the number of workers](https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/main/ortools/sat/docs/troubleshooting.md#improving-performance-with-multiple-workers).

### Assumptions

Quite often you want to find out what happens if you force some variables to a
specific value. Because you possibly want to do that multiple times, you do not
want to copy the whole model. CP-SAT has a nice option of adding assumptions
that you can clear afterwards, without needing to copy the object to test the
next assumptions. This is a feature also known from many SAT-solvers and CP-SAT
also only allows this feature for boolean literals. You cannot add any more
complicated expressions here, but for boolean literals it seems to be pretty
efficient. By adding some auxiliary boolean variables, you can also use this
technique to play around with more complicated expressions without the need to
copy the model. If you really need to temporarily add complex constraints, you
may have to copy the model using `model.CopyFrom` (maybe you also need to copy
the variables. Need to check that.).

```python
model.AddAssumptions([b1, b2.Not()])  # assume b1=True, b2=False
model.AddAssumption(b3)  # assume b3=True (single literal)
# ... solve again and analyse ...
model.ClearAssumptions()  # clear all assumptions
```

> An **assumption** is a temporary fixation of a boolean variable to true or
> false. It can be efficiently handled by a SAT-solver (and thus probably also
> by CP-SAT) and does not harm the learned clauses (but can reuse them).

### Hints

Maybe we already have a good intuition on how the solution will look like (this
could be, because we already solved a similar model, have a good heuristic,
etc.). In this case it may be useful, to tell CP-SAT about it, so it can
incorporate this knowledge into its search. For Mixed Integer Programming
Solver, this often yields a visible boost, even with mediocre heuristic
solutions. For CP-SAT I actually also encountered downgrades of the performance
if the hints weren't great (but this may depend on the problem).

```python
model.AddHint(x, 1)  # Tell CP-SAT that x will probably be 1
model.AddHint(y, 2)  # and y probably be 2.
```

You can also find
[an official example](https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/stable/ortools/sat/samples/solution_hinting_sample_sat.py).

To make sure, your hints are actually correct, you can use the following
parameters to make CP-SAT throw an error if your hints are wrong.

```python
solver.parameters.debug_crash_on_bad_hint = True
```

If you have the feeling that your hints are not used, you may have made a
logical error in your model or just have a bug in your code. This parameter will
tell you about it.

(TODO: Have not tested this, yet)

### Logging

Sometimes it is useful to activate logging to see what is going on. This can be
achieved by setting the following two parameters.

```python
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
solver.parameters.log_search_progress = True
solver.log_callback = print  # (str)->None
```

If you get a doubled output, remove the last line.

The output can look as follows:

The log is actually very interesting to understand CP-SAT, but also to learn
about the optimization problem at hand. It gives you a lot of details on, e.g.,
how many variables could be directly removed or which techniques contributed to
lower and upper bounds the most.

As the log can be quite overwhelming, I developed a small tool to visualize and
comment the log. You can just copy and paste your log into it, and it will
automatically show you the most important details. Also be sure to check out the
examples in it.

### Decision Strategy

In the end of this section, a more advanced parameter that looks interesting for
advanced users as it gives some insights into the search algorithm, **but is
probably better left alone**.

We can tell CP-SAT, how to branch (or make a decision) whenever it can no longer
deduce anything via propagation. For this, we need to provide a list of the
variables (order may be important for some strategies), define which variable
should be selected next (fixed variables are automatically skipped), and define
which value should be probed.

We have the following options for variable selection:

- `CHOOSE_FIRST`: the first not-fixed variable in the list.
- `CHOOSE_LOWEST_MIN`: the variable that could (potentially) take the lowest
  value.
- `CHOOSE_HIGHEST_MAX`: the variable that could (potentially) take the highest
  value.
- `CHOOSE_MIN_DOMAIN_SIZE`: the variable that has the fewest feasible
  assignments.
- `CHOOSE_MAX_DOMAIN_SIZE`: the variable the has the most feasible assignments.

For the value/domain strategy, we have the options:

- `SELECT_MIN_VALUE`: try to assign the smallest value.
- `SELECT_MAX_VALUE`: try to assign the largest value.
- `SELECT_LOWER_HALF`: branch to the lower half.
- `SELECT_UPPER_HALF`: branch to the upper half.
- `SELECT_MEDIAN_VALUE`: try to assign the median value.

> **CAVEAT:** In the documentation there is a warning about the completeness of
> the domain strategy. I am not sure, if this is just for custom strategies or
> you have to be careful in general. So be warned.

```python
model.AddDecisionStrategy([x], cp_model.CHOOSE_FIRST, cp_model.SELECT_MIN_VALUE)

# your can force CP-SAT to follow this strategy exactly
solver.parameters.search_branching = cp_model.FIXED_SEARCH
```

For example for [coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring) (with
integer representation of the color), we could order the variables by decreasing
neighborhood size (`CHOOSE_FIRST`) and then always try to assign the lowest
color (`SELECT_MIN_VALUE`). This strategy should perform an implicit
kernelization, because if we need at least $k$ colors, the vertices with less
than $k$ neighbors are trivial (and they would not be relevant for any
conflict). Thus, by putting them at the end of the list, CP-SAT will only
consider them once the vertices with higher degree could be colored without any
conflict (and then the vertices with lower degree will, too). Another strategy
may be to use `CHOOSE_LOWEST_MIN` to always select the vertex that has the
lowest color available. Whether this will actually help, has to be evaluated:
CP-SAT will probably notice by itself which vertices are the critical ones after
some conflicts.

> :warning: I played around a little with selecting a manual search strategy.
> But even for the coloring, where this may even seem smart, it only gave an
> advantage for a bad model and after improving the model by symmetry breaking,
> it performed worse. Further, I assume that CP-SAT can learn the best strategy
> (Gurobi does such a thing, too) much better dynamically on its own.

## How does it work?

CP-SAT is a versatile _portfolio_ solver, centered around a _Lazy Clause
Generation (LCG)_ based Constraint Programming Solver, although it encompasses a
broader spectrum of technologies.

In its role as a portfolio solver, CP-SAT concurrently executes a multitude of
diverse algorithms and strategies, each possessing unique strengths and
weaknesses. These elements operate largely independently but engage in
information exchange, sharing progress when better solutions emerge or tighter
bounds become available.

While this may initially appear as an inefficient approach due to potential
redundancy, it proves highly effective in practice. The rationale behind this
lies in the inherent challenge of predicting which algorithm is best suited to
solve a given problem (No Free Lunch Theorem). Thus, the pragmatic strategy
involves running various approaches in parallel, with the hope that one will
effectively address the problem at hand. Note that you can also specify which
algorithms should be used if you already know which strategies are promising or
futile.

In contrast, Branch and Cut-based Mixed Integer Programming solvers like Gurobi
implement a more efficient partitioning of the search space to reduce
redundancy. However, they specialize in a particular strategy, which may not
always be the optimal choice, although it frequently proves to be so.

CP-SAT employs Branch and Cut techniques, including linear relaxations and
cutting planes, as part of its toolkit. Models that can be efficiently addressed
by a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solver are typically a good match for
CP-SAT as well. Nevertheless, CP-SAT's central focus is the implementation of
Lazy Clause Generation, harnessing SAT-solvers rather than relying primarily on
linear relaxations. As a result, CP-SAT may exhibit somewhat reduced performance
when confronted with MIP problems compared to dedicated MIP solvers. However, it
gains a distinct advantage when dealing with problems laden with intricate
logical constraints.

The concept behind Lazy Clause Generation involves the (incremental)
transformation of the problem into a SAT-formula, subsequently employing a
SAT-solver to seek a solution (or prove bounds by infeasibility). To mitigate
the impracticality of a straightforward conversion, Lazy Clause Generation
leverages an abundance of lazy variables and clauses.

Notably, the
[Cook-Levin Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook%E2%80%93Levin_theorem)
attests that any problem within the realm of NP can be translated into a
SAT-formula. Optimization, in theory, could be achieved through a simple binary
search. However, this approach, while theoretically sound, lacks efficiency.
CP-SAT employs a more refined encoding scheme to tackle optimization problems
more effectively.

### What happens in CP-SAT on solve?

What actually happens when you execute `solver.Solve(model)`?

1. The model is read.
2. The model is verified.
3. Preprocessing (multiple iterations):
   1. Presolve (domain reduction)
   2. Expanding higher-level constraints to lower-level constraints. See also
      the analogous
      [FlatZinc and Flattening](https://www.minizinc.org/doc-2.5.5/en/flattening.html).
   3. Detection of equivalent variables and
      [affine relations](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cass/courses/m309-03a/a1/olafson/affine_fuctions.htm).
   4. Substitute these by canonical representations
   5. Probe some variables to detect if they are actually fixed or detect
      further equivalences.
4. Load the preprocessed model into the underlying solver and create the linear
   relaxations.
5. **Search for solutions and bounds with the different solvers until the lower
   and upper bound match or another termination criterion is reached (e.g., time
   limit)**
6. Transform solution back to original model.

This is taken from [this talk](https://youtu.be/lmy1ddn4cyw?t=434) and slightly
extended.

### The use of linear programming techniques

As already mentioned before, CP-SAT also utilizes the (dual) simplex algorithm
and linear relaxations. The linear relaxation is implemented as a propagator and
potentially executed at every node in the search tree but only at lowest
priority. A significant difference to the application of linear relaxations in
branch and bound algorithms is that only some pivot iterations are performed (to
make it faster). However, as there are likely much deeper search trees and the
warm-starts are utilized, the optimal linear relaxation may still be computed,
just deeper down the tree (note that for SAT-solving, the search tree is usually
traversed DFS). At root level, even cutting planes such as Gomory-Cuts are
applied to improve the linear relaxation.

The linear relaxation is used for detecting infeasibility (IPs can actually be
more powerful than simple SAT, at least in theory), finding better bounds for
the objective and variables, and also for making branching decisions (using the
linear relaxation's objective and the reduced costs).

The used Relaxation Induced Neighborhood Search RINS (LNS worker), a very
successful heuristic, of course also uses linear programming.

### Limitations of CP-SAT

While CP-SAT is undeniably a potent solver, it does possess certain limitations
when juxtaposed with alternative techniques:

1. While proficient, it may not match the speed of a dedicated SAT-solver when
   tasked with solving SAT-formulas, although its performance remains quite
   commendable.
2. Similarly, for classical MIP-problems, CP-SAT may not outpace dedicated
   MIP-solvers in terms of speed, although it still delivers respectable
   performance.
3. Unlike MIP/LP-solvers, CP-SAT lacks support for continuous variables, and the
   workarounds to incorporate them may not always be highly efficient. In cases
   where your problem predominantly features continuous variables and linear
   constraints, opting for an LP-solver is likely to yield significantly
   improved performance.
4. CP-SAT does not offer support for lazy constraints or iterative model
   building, a feature available in MIP/LP-solvers and select SAT-solvers.
   Consequently, the application of exponential-sized models, which are common
   and pivotal in Mixed Integer Programming, may be restricted.
5. CP-SAT is limited to the Simplex algorithm and does not feature interior
   point methods. This limitation prevents it from employing polynomial time
   algorithms for certain classes of quadratic constraints, such as Second Order
   Cone constraints. In contrast, solvers like Gurobi utilize the Barrier
   algorithm to efficiently tackle these constraints in polynomial time.

CP-SAT might also exhibit inefficiency when confronted with certain constraints,
such as modulo constraints. However, it's noteworthy that I am not aware of any
alternative solver capable of efficiently addressing these specific constraints.
At times, NP-hard problems inherently pose formidable challenges, leaving us
with no alternative but to seek more manageable modeling approaches instead of
looking for better solvers.

## Benchmarking your Model

Benchmarking is an essential step if your model isn't yet meeting the
performance standards of your application or if you're aiming for an academic
publication. This process involves analyzing your model's performance,
especially important if your model has adjustable parameters. Running your model
on a set of predefined instances (a benchmark) allows you to fine-tune these
parameters and compare results. Moreover, if alternative models exist,
benchmarking helps you ascertain whether your model truly outperforms these
competitors.

Designing an effective benchmark is a nuanced task that demands expertise. This
section aims to guide you in creating a reliable benchmark suitable for
publication purposes.

Given the breadth and complexity of benchmarking, our focus will be on the
basics, particularly through the lens of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
as previously discussed in the `AddCircuit` section. We refer to the different
model implementations as 'solvers', and we'll explore four specific types:

- A solver employing the `AddCircuit` approach.
- A solver based on the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin formulation.
- A solver utilizing the Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson formulation with iterative
  addition of subtour constraints until a connected tour is achieved.
- A Gurobi-based solver applying the Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson formulation via
  Lazy Constraints, which are not supported by CP-SAT.

This example highlights common challenges in benchmarking and strategies to
address them. A key obstacle in solving NP-hard problems is the variability in
solver performance across different instances. For instance, a solver might
easily handle a large instance but struggle with a smaller one, and vice versa.
Consequently, it's crucial to ensure that your benchmark encompasses a
representative variety of instances. This diversity is vital for drawing
meaningful conclusions, such as the maximum size of a TSP instance that can be
solved or the most effective solver to use.

For a comprehensive exploration of benchmarking, I highly recommend Catherine C.
McGeoch's book,
["A Guide to Experimental Algorithmics"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/guide-to-experimental-algorithmics/CDB0CB718F6250E0806C909E1D3D1082),
which offers an in-depth discussion on this topic.

### Distinguishing Exploratory and Workhorse Studies in Benchmarking

Before diving into comprehensive benchmarking, it’s essential to conduct
preliminary investigations to assess your model’s capabilities and identify any
foundational issues. This phase, known as _exploratory studies_, is crucial for
establishing the basis for more detailed benchmarking, subsequently termed as
_workhorse studies_. These latter studies aim to provide reliable answers to
specific research questions and are often the core of academic publications.
It's important to explicitly differentiate between these two study types and
maintain their distinct purposes: exploratory studies for initial understanding
and flexibility, and workhorse studies for rigorous, reproducible research.

#### Exploratory Studies: Foundation Building

Exploratory studies serve as an introduction to both your model and the problem
it addresses. This phase is about gaining preliminary understanding and
insights.

- **Objective**: The goal here is to gather early insights rather than
  definitive conclusions. This phase is instrumental in identifying realistic
  problem sizes, potential challenges, and narrowing down hyperparameter search
  spaces.

For instance, in the `AddCircuit`-section, an exploratory study helped us
determine that our focus should be on instances with 100 to 200 nodes. If you
encounter fundamental issues with your model at this stage, it’s advisable to
address these before proceeding to workhorse studies.

> Occasionally, the primary performance bottleneck in your model may not be
> CP-SAT but rather the Python segment where the model is being generated. In
> these instances, identifying the most resource-intensive parts of your Python
> code is crucial. I have found the profiler
> [Scalene](https://github.com/plasma-umass/scalene) to be well-suited to
> investigate and pinpoint these bottlenecks.

#### Workhorse Studies: Conducting In-depth Evaluations

Workhorse studies follow the exploratory phase, characterized by more structured
and meticulous approaches. This stage is vital for a comprehensive evaluation of
your model and collecting substantive data for analysis.

- **Objective**: These studies are designed to answer specific research
  questions and provide meaningful insights. The approach here is more
  methodical, focusing on clearly defined research questions. The benchmarks
  designed should be well-structured and large enough to yield statistically
  significant results.

Remember, the aim is not to create a flawless benchmark right away but to evolve
it as concrete questions emerge and as your understanding of the model and
problem deepens. These studies, unlike exploratory ones, will be the focus of
your scientific publications, with exploratory studies only referenced for
justifying certain design decisions.

**Hint: Use the
[SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Checklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SIGPLAN/empirical-evaluation/master/checklist/checklist.pdf)
if your evaluation has to satisfy academic standards.**

### Designing a Robust Benchmark for Effective Studies

When undertaking both exploratory and workhorse studies, the creation of a
well-designed benchmark is a critical step. This benchmark is the basis upon
which you'll test and evaluate your solvers. For exploratory studies, your
benchmark can start simple and progressively evolve. However, when it comes to
workhorse studies, the design of your benchmark demands meticulous attention to
ensure comprehensiveness and reliability.

While exploratory studies also benefit from a thoughtfully designed benchmark—as
it accelerates insight acquisition—the primary emphasis at this stage is to have
a functioning benchmark in place. This initial benchmark acts as a springboard,
providing a foundation for deeper, more detailed analysis in the subsequent
workhorse studies. The key is to balance the immediacy of starting with a
benchmark against the long-term goal of refining it for more rigorous
evaluations.

Ideally, a robust benchmark would consist of a large set of real-world
instances, closely reflecting the actual performance of your solver. Real-world
instances, however, are often limited in quantity and may not provide enough
data for a statistically significant benchmark. In such cases, it's advisable to
explore existing benchmarks from literature, like the
[TSPLIB](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/) for TSP.
Leveraging established benchmarks allows for comparison with prior studies, but
be cautious about their quality, as not all are equally well-constructed. For
example, TSPLIB's limitations in terms of instance size variation and
heterogeneity can hinder result aggregation.

Therefore, creating custom instances might be necessary. When doing so, aim for
enough instances per size category to establish reliable and statistically
significant data points. For instance, generating 10 instances for each size
category (e.g., 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500) can
provide a solid basis for analysis. This approach, though modest in scale,
suffices to illustrate the benchmarking process.

Exercise caution with random instance generators, as they may not accurately
represent real-world scenarios. For example, randomly generated TSP instances
might lack collinear points common in real-world situations, like houses aligned
on straight roads, or they might not replicate real-world clustering patterns.
To better mimic reality, incorporate real-world data or use diverse generation
methods to ensure a broader variety of instances. For the TSP, we could for
example also have sampled from the larger TSPLIB instances.

Consider conducting your evaluation using two distinct benchmarks, especially
when dealing with different data types. For instance, you might have one
benchmark derived from real-world data which, although highly relevant, is too
limited in size to provide robust statistical insights. Simultaneously, you
could use a second benchmark based on a larger set of random instances, better
suited for detailed statistical analysis. This dual-benchmark approach allows
you to demonstrate the consistency and reliability of your results, ensuring
they are not merely artifacts of a particular dataset's characteristics. It's a
strategy that adds depth to your evaluation, showcasing the robustness of your
findings across varied data sources. We will use this approach below, generating
robust plots from random instances, but also comparing them to real-world
instances. Mixing the two benchmarks would not be advisable, as the random
instances would dominate the results.

Lastly, always separate the creation of your benchmark from the execution of
experiments. Create and save instances in a separate process to minimize errors.
The goal is to make your evaluation as error-proof as possible, avoiding the
frustration and wasted effort of basing decisions on flawed data. Be
particularly cautious with pseudo-random number generators; while theoretically
deterministic, their use can inadvertently lead to irreproducible results.
Sharing benchmarks is also more straightforward when you can distribute the
instances themselves, rather than the code used to generate them.

### Efficiently Managing Your Benchmarks

Managing benchmark data can become complex, especially with multiple experiments
and research questions. Here are some strategies to keep things organized:

- **Folder Structure**: Maintain a clear folder structure for your experiments,
  with a top-level `evaluations` folder and descriptive subfolders for each
  experiment. For our experiment we have the following structure:
  ```
  evaluations
  ├── tsp
  │   ├── 2023-11-18_random_euclidean
  │   │   ├── PRIVATE_DATA
  │   │   │   ├── ... all data for debugging
  │   │   ├── PUBLIC_DATA
  │   │   │   ├── ... selected data to share
  │   │   ├── README.md: Provide a short description of the experiment
  │   │   ├── 00_generate_instances.py
  │   │   ├── 01_run_experiments.py
  │   │   ├── ....
  │   ├── 2023-11-18_tsplib
  │   │   ├── PRIVATE_DATA
  │   │   │   ├── ... all data for debugging
  │   │   ├── PUBLIC_DATA
  │   │   │   ├── ... selected data to share
  │   │   ├── README.md: Provide a short description of the experiment
  │   │   ├── 01_run_experiments.py
  │   │   ├── ....
  ```
- **Redundancy and Documentation**: While some redundancy is acceptable,
  comprehensive documentation of each experiment is crucial for future
  reference.
- **Simplified Results**: Keep a streamlined version of your results for easy
  access, especially for plotting and sharing.
- **Data Storage**: Save all your data, even if it seems insignificant at the
  time. This ensures you have a comprehensive dataset for later analysis or
  unexpected inquiries. Because this can become a lot of data, it's advisable to
  have two folders: One with all data and one with a selection of data that you
  want to share.
- **Experiment Flexibility**: Design experiments to be interruptible and
  extendable, allowing for easy resumption or modification. This is especially
  important for exploratory studies, where you may need to make frequent
  adjustments. However, if your workhorse study takes a long time to run, you
  don't want to repeat it from scratch if you want to add a further solver.
- **Utilizing Technology**: Employ tools like slurm for efficient distribution
  of experiments across computing clusters, saving time and resources. The
  faster you have your results, the faster you can act on them.

Due to a lack of tools that exactly fitted my needs I developed
[AlgBench](https://github.com/d-krupke/AlgBench) to manage the results, and
[Slurminade](https://github.com/d-krupke/slurminade) to easily distribute the
experiments on a cluster via a simple decorator. However, there may be better
tools out there, now, especially from the Machine Learning community. Drop me a
quick mail if you have found some tools you are happy with, and I will take a
look myself.

### Analyzing the results

Let us now come to the actual analysis of the results. We will focus on the
following questions:

- Up to which size can we solve TSP instances with the different solvers?
- Which solver is the fastest?
- How does the performance change if we increase the optimality tolerance?

> **Our Benchmarks:** We executed the four solvers with a time limit of 90s and
> the optimality tolerances [0.1%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%] on a random benchmark set
> and a TSPLIB benchmark set. The random benchmark set consists of 10 instances

Let us first look at the results of the random benchmark, as they are easier to
interpret. We will then compare them to the TSPLIB benchmark.

#### Random Instances

A common, yet simplistic method to assess a model's performance involves
plotting its runtime against the size of the instances it processes. However,
this approach can often lead to inaccurate interpretations, particularly because
time-limited cutoffs can disproportionately affect the results. Instead of the
expected exponential curves, you will get skewed sigmoidal curves. Consequently,
such plots might not provide a clear understanding of the instance sizes your
model is capable of handling efficiently.

|                                                                                                      ![Runtime](./evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_random_euclidean/PUBLIC_DATA/runtime.png)                                                                                                      |
| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| The runtimes are sigmoidal instead of exponential because the time limit skews the results. The runtime can frequently exceed the time limit, because of expensive model building, etc. Thus, a pure runtime plot says surprisingly little (or is misleading) and can usually be discarded. |

To gain a more accurate insight into the capacities of your model, consider
plotting the proportion of instances of a certain size that your model
successfully solves. This method requires a well-structured benchmark to yield
meaningful statistics for each data point. Without this structure, the resulting
curve may appear erratic, making it challenging to draw dependable conclusions.

| ![Solved over size](./evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_random_euclidean/PUBLIC_DATA/solved_over_size.png) |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|   For each x-value: What are the chances (y-values) that a model of this size (x) can be solved?    |

Furthermore, if the pursuit is not limited to optimal solutions but extends to
encompass solutions of acceptable quality, the analysis can be expanded. One can
plot the number of instances that the model solves within a defined optimality
tolerance, as demonstrated in the subsequent figure:

| ![Solved over size with optimality tolerance](./evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_random_euclidean/PUBLIC_DATA/solved_over_size_opt_tol.png) |
| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|      For each x-value: What are the chances (y-values) that a model of this size (x) can be solved to what quality (line style)?      |

For a comparative analysis across various models against an arbitrary benchmark,
cactus plots emerge as a potent tool. These plots illustrate the number of
instances solved over time, providing a clear depiction of a model's efficiency.
For example, a coordinate of $x=10, y=20$ on such a plot signifies that 20
instances were solved within a span of 10 seconds each. It is important to note,
however, that these plots do not facilitate predictions for any specific
instance unless the benchmark set is thoroughly familiar. They do allow for an
estimation of which model is quicker for simpler instances and which can handle
more challenging instances within a reasonable timeframe. The question of what
exactly is a simple or challenging instance, however, is better answered by the
previous plots.

Cactus plots are notably prevalent in the evaluation of SAT-solvers, where
instance size is a poor indicator of difficulty. A more detailed discussion on
this subject can be found in the referenced academic paper:
[Benchmarking Solvers, SAT-style by Brain, Davenport, and Griggio](http://www.sc-square.org/CSA/workshop2-papers/RP3-FinalVersion.pdf)

|        ![Cactus Plot 1](./evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_random_euclidean/PUBLIC_DATA/cactus_plot.png)         |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| For each x-value: How many (y) of the benchmark instances could have been solved with this time limit (x)? |

Additionally, the analysis can be refined to account for different quality
tolerances. This requires either multiple experimental runs or tracking the
progression of the lower and upper bounds within the solver. In the context of
CP-SAT, for instance, this tracking can be implemented via the Solution
Callback, although its activation is may depend on updates to the objective
rather than the bounds.

|                      ![Cactus Plot 1](./evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_random_euclidean/PUBLIC_DATA/cactus_plot_opt_tol.png)                      |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| For each x-value: How many (y) of the benchmark instances could have been solved to a specific quality (line style) with this time limit (x)? |

Instead of plotting the number of solved instances, one can also plot the number
of unsolved instances over time. This can be easier to read and additionally
indicates the number of instances in the benchmark. However, I personally do not
have a preference for one or the other, and would recommend using the one that
is more intuitive to read for you.

#### TSPLIB

Our second benchmark for the Traveling Salesman Problem leverages the TSPLIB, a
set of instances based on real-world data. This will introduce two challenges:

1. The difficulty in aggregating benchmark data due to its limited size and
   heterogeneous nature.
2. Notable disparities in results, arising from the differing characteristics of
   random and real-world instances.

The irregularity in instance sizes makes traditional plotting methods, like
plotting the number of solved instances over time, less effective. While data
smoothing methods, such as rolling averages, are available, they too have their
limitations.

|                   ![Variation in Data](./evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_tsplib/PUBLIC_DATA/solved_over_size.png)                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Such a plot may prove inefficient when dealing with high variability, particularly when some data points are underrepresented. |

In contrast, the cactus plot still provides a clear and comprehensive
perspective of various model performances. An interesting observation we can
clearly see in it, is the diminished capability of the "Iterative Dantzig" model
in solving instances, and a closer performance alignment between the
`AddCircuit` and Gurobi models.

|          ![Effective Cactus Plot](./evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_tsplib/PUBLIC_DATA/cactus_plot_opt_tol.png)           |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Cactus plots maintain clarity and relevance, and show a performance differences between TSPLib and random instances. |

However, since cactus plots do not offer insights into individual instances,
it's beneficial to complement them with a detailed table of results for the
specific model you are focusing on. This approach ensures a more nuanced
understanding of model performance across varied instances. The following table
provides the results for the `AddCircuit`-model.

| Instance | # nodes | runtime | lower bound | objective | opt. gap |

This should highlight that often you need a combination of different benchmarks
and plots to get a good understanding of the performance of your model.

### Conclusion

Benchmarking solvers for NP-hard problems is not as straightforward as it might
seem at first. There are many pitfalls and often there is no perfect solution.
On the example of the TSP, we have seen how we can still get some useful results
and nice plots on which we can base our decisions.

## Using CP-SAT for Bigger Problems with Large Neighborhood Search

CP-SAT is great at solving small and medium-sized problems. But what if you have
a really big problem on your hands? One option might be to use a special kind of
algorithm known as a "meta-heuristic", like a
[genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm). But these
can be hard to set up and might not even give you good results.

Sometimes you will see new algorithms with cool-sounding names in scientific
papers. While tempting, these are often just small twists on older methods and
might leave out key details that make them work. If you're interested, there's a
discussion about this issue in a paper by Sörensen, called
["Metaheuristics – The Metaphor Exposed"](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/itor.12001/).

The good news? You do not have to implement an algorithm that simulates the
mating behavior of forest frogs to solve your problem. If you already know how
to use CP-SAT, you can stick with it to solve big problems without adding
unnecessary complications. Even better? This technique, called Large
Neighborhood Search, often outperforms all other approaches.

### What Sets Large Neighborhood Search Apart?

Many traditional methods generate several "neighbor" options around an existing
solution and pick the best one. However, making each neighbor solution takes
time, limiting how many you can examine.

Enter Large Neighborhood Search (LNS). Instead of making individual neighbor
solutions one by one, LNS sets up a "mini-problem". This mini-problem allows us
to tweak some parts of the existing solution. Often, this involves randomly
selecting some variables and resetting them. Then the mini-problem aims to find
the best new values for these reset variables, given the rest of the current
solution. To do this, we can use CP-SAT, which efficiently finds the optimal new
values for us. This process of wiping out and reassigning values is sometimes
called "destroy and repair."

The advantage? LNS can explore a much bigger range of neighbor solutions without
having to make them one at a time.

What's more, LNS can easily be mixed with other methods like genetic algorithms.
If you are already using a genetic algorithm, you could supercharge it by
applying CP-SAT to find the best possible crossover of two or more existing
solutions. It's like genetic engineering, but without any ethical worries!

When looking into the logs of CP-SAT, you may notice that it uses LNS itself to
find better solutions.

```
8 incomplete subsolvers: [feasibility_pump, graph_arc_lns, graph_cst_lns, graph_dec_lns, graph_var_lns, rins/rens, rnd_cst_lns, rnd_var_lns]
```

Why does it not suffice to just run CP-SAT if it already solves the problem with
LNS? The reason is that CP-SAT has to be relatively problem-agnostic. It has no
way of knowing the structure of your problem and thus cannot use this
information to improve the search. You on the other hand know a lot about your
problem and can use this knowledge to implement a more efficient version.

**Literature:**

- General Paper on LNS-variants:
  [Pisinger and Ropke - 2010](https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/5293785/Pisinger.pdf)
- A generic variant (RINS), that is also used by CP-SAT:
  [Danna et al. 2005](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-004-0518-7)

We will now look into some examples to see this approach in action.

#### Example 1: Knapsack

You are given a knapsack that can carry a certain weight limit $C$, and you have
various items $I$ you can put into it. Each item $i\in I$ has a weight $w_i$ and
a value $v_i$. The goal is to pick items to maximize the total value while
staying within the weight limit.

$$\max \sum_{i \in I} v_i x_i$$

$$\text{s.t.} \sum_{i \in I} w_i x_i \leq C$$

$$x_i \in \\{0,1\\}$$

This is one of the simplest NP-hard problems and can be solved with a dynamic
programming approach in pseudo-polynomial time. CP-SAT is also able to solve
many large instances of this problem in an instant. However, its simple
structure makes it a good example to demonstrate the use of Large Neighborhood
Search, even if the algorithm will not be of much use for this problem.

A simple idea for the LNS is to delete some elements from the current solution,
compute the remaining capacity after deletion, select some additional items from
the remaining items, and try to find the optimal solution to fill the remaining
capacity with the deleted items and the newly selected items. Repeat this until
you are happy with the solution quality. The number of items you delete and
select can be fixed such that the problem can be easily solved by CP-SAT. You
can find a full implementation under
[examples/lns_knapsack.ipynb](examples/lns_knapsack.ipynb).

Let us look only on an example here:

Instance: $C=151$,
$I=I_{0}(w=12, v=37),I_{1}(w=16, v=49),I_{2}(w=20, v=53),I_{3}(w=11, v=14),I_{4}(w=19, v=42),$

Initial solution of value 442:
$\\{I_{0}, I_{1}, I_{2}, I_{3}, I_{4}, I_{5}, I_{6}, I_{7}, I_{8}, I_{9}\\}$

We will now repeatedly delete 5 items from the current solution and try to fill
the newly gained capacity with an optimal solution built from the deleted items
and 10 additional items. Note that this approach essentially considers
$2^{5+10}=32768$ neighbored solutions in each iteration. However, we could
easily scale it up to consider $2^{100+900}\sim 10^{300}$ neighbored solutions
in each iteration thanks to the implicit representation of the neighbored
solutions and CP-SAT ability to prune large parts of the search space.

#### Example 2: Different Neighborhoods for the Traveling Salesman Problem

Simply removing a portion of the solution and then trying to fix it isn't the
most effective approach. In this section, we'll explore various neighborhoods
for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The geometry of TSP not only permits
advantageous neighborhoods but also offers visually appealing representations.
When you have several neighborhood strategies, they can be dynamically
integrated using an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS).

The image illustrates an optimization process for a tour that needs to traverse
the green areas, factoring in turn costs, within an embedded graph (mesh). The
optimization involves choosing specific regions (highlighted in red) and
calculating the optimal tour within them. As iterations progress, the initial
tour generally improves, although some iterations may not yield any enhancement.
Regions in red are selected due to the high cost of the tour within them. Once
optimized, the center of that region is added to a tabu list, preventing it from
being chosen again.

| Large Neighbordhood Search for Coverage Path Planning by repeatedly selecting a geometric region (red) and optimizing the tour within it. The red parts of the tour highlight the changes in the iteration. Read from left to right, and from up to down. |

How can you determine the appropriate size of a region to select? You have two
main options: conduct preliminary experiments or adjust the size adaptively
during the search. Simply allocate a time limit for each iteration. If the
solver doesn't optimize within that timeframe, decrease the region size.
Conversely, if it does, increase the size. Utilizing exponential factors will
help the size swiftly converge to its optimal dimension. However, it's essential
to note that this method assumes subproblems are of comparable difficulty and
may necessitate additional conditions.

For the Euclidean TSP, as opposed to a mesh, optimizing regions isn't
straightforward. Multiple effective strategies exist, such as employing a
segment from the previous tour rather than a geometric region. By implementing
various neighborhoods and evaluating their success rates, you can allocate a
higher selection probability to the top-performing ones. This approach is
demonstrated in an animation crafted by two of my students, Gabriel Gehrke and
Laurenz Illner. They incorporated four distinct neighborhoods and utilized ALNS
to dynamically select the most effective one.

| Animation of an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search for the classical Traveling Salesman Problem. It uses four different neighborhood strategies which are selected randomly with a probability based on their success rate in previous iterations. If you check the logs of the latest (v9.8) version of CP-SAT, it also rates the performance of its LNS-strategies and uses the best performing strategies more often (UCB1-algorithm). |

#### Multi-Armed Bandit: Exploration vs. Exploitation

Having multiple strategies for each iteration of your LNS available is great,
but how do you decide which one to use? You could just pick one randomly, but
this is not very efficient as it is unlikely to select the best one. You could
also use the strategy that worked best in the past, but maybe there is a better
one you haven't tried yet. This is the so-called exploration vs. exploitation
dilemma. You want to exploit the strategies that worked well in the past, but
you also want to explore new strategies to find even better ones. Luckily, this
problem has been studied extensively as the
[Multi-Armed Bandit Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit)
for decades, and there are many good solutions. One of the most popular ones is
the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB1) algorithm, which is also used by CP-SAT. In
the following, you can see the a LNS-statistic of the CP-SATs strategies.

```

We will not dig into the details of the algorithm here, but if you are
interested, you can find many good resources online. I just wanted to make you
aware of the exploration vs. exploitation dilemma and that many smart people
have already thought about it.
